/*
 Time complexity -> O(n * logn) time
 In merge sort we divide the array into halves and keep dividing them till halves are unbreakable
 Now merge these halves in sorted order

    6 , 3 , 2 , 4 , 1 , 5

    632 | 415
    
    63 | 2 | 41 | 5

    6 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 5

    36 | 2 | 14 | 5

    236 | 145

    123456

    sorted

    Where to use
     - Time is a concern

    Where not to use
     - Space is a concern
